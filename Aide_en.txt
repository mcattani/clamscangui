An antivirus, clamav, under Linux:
- When we install an antivirus under Linux it is to use it in another way. What is the interest?
- Clamav allows, above all, to verify that one does not transmit or retransmit a contaminated file, either as an attachment in an email or through a USB memory.

Software menus:

The options :
Recursive scan:
- The most important option because it allows you to follow the full path of the file being analyzed. Slow down the analysis (a bit).

The other options:
- They are to display the results of the analysis in the text area of ​​the main window.

Advanced Options:
More options:
- To choose whether or not certain types of files are scanned. (By default, all scanners)

Delete contaminated files:
- Relatively dangerous option if we take into account the number of false positives that the antivirus can generate.

Detect potentially unwanted applications (PUAs):
- The antivirus is more aggressive with this option but generates more false positives (it depends on you)

Move potentially infected files to quarantine:
- Activate the menu: Actions file potentially infected
- Provides faster access to potentially infected files; either to destroy or restore them in case of false positives.
- Here again, be careful with its use, the deletion of a file happens quickly.

Upgrade of data base:
- Clamav comes with an updater called freshclam that can (by default) perform updates automatically or manually.
- You can check its status by reading the log file.

Behavior:
Potentially infected files:
- If active, allows you to view and then act on the files that were actually moved to Quarantine (destruction, restoration or no action)

Log in:
- Allows you to view the analyzes performed during the session.

History:
- Allows you to see all the analyzes performed as long as you do not delete them.

Languages ​​:
- You can currently choose between three languages ​​in which the software has been translated (English, Spanish or French)

A point about the analysis:
- As stated in the FAQ, clamav antivirus does not repair infected files.
- some viruses in Linux can act without authorization.
- authorization is the important word in Linux because whatever your distribution, you know that until you give authorization, a file cannot act on its own.
- What to scan?
essentially the "things" that you record on your machine or some other medium.
eg your entire home directory (home / user) with hidden files (/.something).
To put your mind at ease, you can run a scan of your entire machine, but you can go get coffee and take the dog out as it will take a while for it to finish.
