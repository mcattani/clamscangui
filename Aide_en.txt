An antivirus, clamav, under Linux:
- When you install an antivirus in Linux it is to use it in one way or another, what is the point?
- clamav allows, above all, to check that one does not transmit nor retransmit to friends, a contaminated file, whether in the form of email attachment or via USB key.

--- Software menus: ---

	--The options :--

		-Choices :-
- used to display the results of the analysis in the text area of ​​the main window with certain choices.
		-Limitations:
- allow you to set certain file size limits to control

--Advanced options:--

		- Options not checked by default: -
- these options should always be unchecked unless you know what you are doing.
		- Recursive scan:
- The most important option because it allows you to follow the full path of the file being analyzed. This slows down the analysis (a little).
		- Delete contaminated files:
- Relatively dangerous option if we take into account the number of false positives that the antivirus can generate.
		- Detect potentially unwanted applications (PUAs):
- The antivirus is more aggressive with this option but generates more false positives (it depends on you)
		- Move potentially infected files to quarantine:
- Provides faster access to potentially infected files; either to destroy them, or to restore them in the event of false positives.
- Again, be careful with its use, deleting a file is done quickly and permanently.

		- Database upgrade: -
- clamav comes with an updater called freshclam which can (by default) perform updates automatically or manually, you can change the option.
- You can check its status by reading the log file (in English).
- You can check freshclam settings in its configuration file, at: /etc/clamav/freshclam.conf
- You can slightly increase the update recovery time which is by default 30 seconds if you systematically get download errors. With an ADSL connection, 150 seconds is more than enough.

		- Options checked by default: -
You should not uncheck these options.
- To choose whether certain types of files are scanned or not. (By default, all scanners)

	--Actions: -

		- Quarantine: -
- Allows you to act on files placed in quarantine, either automatically if the option has been checked, or by you.
		- Potentially infected files: -
- Allows you to view and then act on the files that have actually been moved to quarantine (destruction, restoration or no action)
		- Session log: -
- Allows you to view the analyzes performed during the session.
		-History:-
- Allows you to see all the analyzes performed before as long as you do not delete them.
(Be careful if the -verbose option is checked, the file can quickly become very large.)
		-Languages ​​:-
- You can currently choose between three languages ​​the software has been translated into (English, Spanish or French)
		-Configuration files: -
- The following files can be viewed or edited if the sudo button is pressed:
	clamd.conf
	freshclam.conf
	milter-clamav.conf

	--The Sudo button: -
- allows you to execute your commands as super user.

A point on the analysis:
- As stated in the FAQ, clamav antivirus does not fix infected files.
- some viruses in Linux can act without authorization.
- authorization is the important word in Linux because whatever your distribution, you know that until you give the authorization, a file cannot act on its own.
- What to scan?
essentially the "things" that one records on his machine or on another medium.
for example, his entire home directory (home / user) with hidden files (/.something).
To reassure yourself, you can run a scan of your whole machine but you can go have a coffee and take the dog out as it will take a while for this to finish.
